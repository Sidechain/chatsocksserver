This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

ChatSocks (server) - a small yet functional example of how to use Sockets.io to make a chat room!

- Checks that there are no users with duplicate names
- Doesn't allow sending empty messages
- Kicks out inactive users
- Logs most useful events to provide insight into how the library works

No state container library?

- No, I wanted to keep the project's footprint as small as possible while still making sure the required specs are met.

What about components or TypeScript?

- Again, my design philosophy was simplicity and minimalism, to allow for coders of all skill levels to gain some insight into Socket.io.
